Project: A game using Unity for WebGL.<br/>
Brief Description: The game is supposed to run on a browser much like a web application.</br>

Verdict From the project (from 2020): Though on paper running a game on a website seems a very compelling idea, the reality is the platform is still not ready. The pixelated and lossy quality of the game is one example. Several Obtimization had to be done to achive the result:</br>
**The 2D assets (i.e. characters, background and other 2D objects) had to be compressed for optimization.</br>
**The resulation had to be dropped from 1080p to 360p.</br>
**The several scenes had to be removed so the game stays lightweight (only 3 scenes was used in the final output whereas total 7 scenses were initaillay created for the project).</br>
**Multiple assets had to be reused.</br>

In the end, large scale gaming on WebGL is not yet fully ready. That is evident from the fact that the industry hasn't pushed very hard for it yet. Though several attepts have been made, it is still in early stages.

Update(2022): Several optization in WebGL have been made. Taking input from a user and running the game on a powerull server and giving the result as output on a browser seems to be the most common optimization.
